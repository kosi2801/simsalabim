# What is SIMsalabim? #
**SIMsalabim** is an application for Google Android phones which allows the users to copy
and manage the contacts which are stored on their SIM card. Google Android currently does
not provide SIM management functionality apart from copying the contacts over to the
phone. SIMsalabim adds this missing functionality by displaying the user all contacts
which are on the phone as well as on the SIM card and letting the user to copy them
around between the phone and SIM memory.
