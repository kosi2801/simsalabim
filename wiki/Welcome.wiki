*SIMsalabim* is a tool to assist with the management of contacts on the SIM cards of mobile phones running Google Android. 
Android, at least as of version 1.6, does not offer the possibility to manage the contacts on your SIM card. This tool
adds this missing functionality. 

SIMsalabim allows following operations on your SIM card :
  * view the contacts
  * copy contacts to the phone contacts list
  * copy contacts from the phone contacts list
  * delete contacts   

= Usage =
Upon startup of SIMsalabim you are presented with tabs containing the contact lists from your phone and your SIM card.
Short press an entry to show details of it, long press to perform the modification activities.

= Planned improvements =
  * ~~edit phone contacts~~ finished, will be in next version  
  * don't crash, if there is a problem accessing the SIM at startup
  * add debug-activity to display SIM data and statistics
  * provide "letter-slider" during scrolling, like in builtin contacts manager
  * more testing with difficult SIM conditions, like being full etc.
  * far future: maybe allow similar management of SMS on SIM card, if Android allows this
